yf_rubi_scraper.py  --- Use yfinance module to create SQL database of stock prices
duff.py --- use pandas df to do lower latency calculations such as calculating MAs to create buy and sell signals (PARTIALLY ERRONEOUS in creating a final profit based on portfolio API but MAs are calculated correctly and singals based off those values in the dataframe are correct.)
